## Inspiration

Don’t we all love retro games?

Don't campus tours fail to spark your enthusiasm for the school?

Combining nostalgic elements of 2D JRPG and the desire to make campus tours less boring, we created CampusLore. This game showcases the rich history, hidden gems, and interesting lores of WPI (Worcester Polytechnic Institute, in case you didn’t know), while providing a fun and interactive experience that matches the in-person options offered by tour guides.

## What it does

CampusLore is a JRPG retro game that brings players on a unique virtual campus tour, interacting with various objects and locations to uncover insider information and intriguing campus stories that most prospective students don’t have access to. Players will engage with the University's history, legends, and anecdotes through a captivating and nostalgic experience.

## How we built it

We used a combination of game development tools, including Godot for the game engine, and the Tiled pixel art software for creating the campus map. We coded the game logic with GDScript, incorporating dialogues to keep players engaged.

## Challenges we ran into

We hugely underestimated the underlying difficulty of game development. We learned the hard way that even for a game of this scope, it still requires a game engine. Our team decided to explore Phaser 3 (HTML5 game framework) and the Godot game engine in parallel. Halfway through, development efforts went to Godot exclusively because Phaser won’t allow for multiple tilesets, which didn’t match up with our asset-making efforts. 
Also, mapmaking is hard.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Learned and utilized a game engine
- Map out the entire campus in 2D
- Writing up campus lores from our memory, scouring through Reddit, Fandom, and our personal experiences.
- Made our own theme song
- …all under 24 hours!

## What we learned
Throughout the development process, we gained valuable experience in game design, pixel art creation, and storytelling. Besides the technical tools used to develop the game, we also learned the importance of effective communication and collaboration within the team to bring together diverse skill sets and create a cohesive gaming experience.

## What's next for CampusLore

In the short run, we plan to complete our own campus by adding all the maps we designed and didn’t have the time to add.

In the long run, some potential additions we will consider include:
- Integrate deep learning models to allow people from other schools to add maps of their own campus simply by uploading pictures. 
- Introduce multiplayer options, allowing friends to explore the campus world together.
- Build additional gameplay features ranging from time-limited challenges to inner building features to further enhance the player experience
